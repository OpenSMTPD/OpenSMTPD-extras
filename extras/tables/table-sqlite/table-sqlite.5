.Sh NAME
.Nm table_sqlite
.Nd format description for smtpd sqlite tables
.Sh DESCRIPTION
This manual page documents the file format of sqlite tables used by the
.Xr smtpd 8
mail daemon.
.Pp
The format described here applies to tables as defined in
.Xr smtpd.conf 5 .
.Sh SQLITE TABLE
A sqlite table allows the storing of usernames, passwords, aliases, and domains
in a format that is shareable across various machines that support
.Xr sqlite3 1
(SQLite version 3).
.Pp
The table is used by
.Xr smtpd 8
when authenticating a user, when user information such as user-id and/or
home directory is required for a delivery, when a domain lookup may be required,
and/or when looking for an alias.
.Pp
A sqlite table consists of one or more
.Xr sqlite3 1
databases with one or more tables.
.Pp
If the table is used for authentication, the password should be
encrypted using the
.Xr crypt 3
function. Such passwords can be generated using the
.Xr encrypt 1
utility or
.Xr smtpctl 8
encrypt command.

.Sh SQLITE TABLE CONFIG FILE

The following configuration options are available:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Xo
.Ic dbpath
.Ar file
.Xc
This is the path to where the DB is located with the dbname.
For example:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
dbpath /etc/mail/smtp.sqlite
.Ed
.Pp

.It Xo
.Ic query_alias
.Ar SQL statement
.Xc
This is used to provide a query to look up aliases. The question mark
is replaced with the appropriate data. For alias it is the left hand side of
the SMTP address. This expects one VARCHAR to be returned with the user name
the alias resolves to.
.Pp

.It Xo
.Ic query_credentials
.Ar SQL statement
.Xc
This is used to provide a query for looking up user credentials. The question
mark is replaced with the appropriate data. For credentials it is the left
hand side of the SMTP address. The query expects that there are two VARCHARS
returned, one with a user name and one with a password in
.Xr crypt 3
format.
.Pp

.It Xo
.Ic query_domain
.Ar SQL statement
.Xc
This is used to provide a query for looking up a domain. The question mark
is replaced with the appropriate data. For the domain it would be the
right hand side of the SMTP address. This expects one VARCHAR to be returned
with a matching domain name.
.El

A generic SQL statement would be something like:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
query_ SELECT value FROM table WHERE key=?;
.Ed

.Sh EXAMPLES
Those provided here a known to work.

.Ic Pa sqlite3 schema
.Bd -literal -compact
CREATE TABLE aliases (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    email VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    destination VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
);
CREATE TABLE credentials (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    email VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    password VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
);
CREATE TABLE domains (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    domain VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
);
.Ed

.Ic Pa /etc/mail/sqlite.conf
.Bd -literal -compact
dbpath /etc/mail/smtp.sqlite
query_alias SELECT destination FROM aliases WHERE email=?;
query_credentials SELECT email, password FROM credentials WHERE email=?;
query_domain SELECT domain FROM domains WHERE domain=?;
.Ed

.Ic Pa /etc/mail/smtpd.conf
.Bd -literal -compact
table domains sqlite:/etc/mail/sqlite.conf
table virtuals sqlite:/etc/mail/sqlite.conf
table credentials sqlite:/etc/mail/sqlite.conf

.Xr table-sqlite 8
configuration file.
