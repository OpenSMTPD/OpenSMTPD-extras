.Sh NAME
.Nm table_sqlite
.Nd format description for smtpd sqlite tables
.Sh DESCRIPTION
This manual page documents the file format of sqlite tables used by the
.Xr smtpd 8
mail daemon.
.Pp
The format described here applies to tables as defined in
.Xr smtpd.conf 5 .
.Sh SQLITE TABLE
A SQLite table allows the storing of usernames, passwords, aliases, and domains
in a format that is shareable across various machines that support SQLite3
.Pp
The table is used by
.Xr smtpd 8
when authenticating a user, when user information such as user-id and/or
home directory is required for a delivery, when a domain lookup may be required,
and/or when looking for an alias.
.Pp
A SQLite table consists of one or more SQLite3 Databases with one or more tables.
.Pp
If the table is used for authentication, the password should be 
encrypted using the
.Xr crypt 3
function.
Such passwords can be generated using the
.Xr encrypt 1
utility or
.Xr smtpctl 8
encrypt command.
.Sh SQLITE TABLE CONFIG FILE
.Cd dbpath
.Dl This is the path to where the DB is located with the dbname.
.Cd query_alias
.Dl This is used to provide a query to look up aliases. All the question marks are replaced
.Dl with the appropriate data, in this case it would be the left hand side of the SMTP address.
.Dl This expects one varchar to be returned with the user name the alias resolves to.
.Cd query_domain
.Dl This is used to provide a query for a domain query call. All the question marks are replaced
.Dl with the appropriate data, in this case it would be the right hand side of the SMTP address.
.Dl This expects one varchar to be returned with a matching domain name.
.Cd query_userinfo
.Dl This is used to provide a query for looking up user information.
.Dl All the question marks are replaced with the appropriate data, in this case it
.Dl would be the left hand side of the SMTP address.
.Dl This expects three fields to be returned an int containing a UID, an int containing a GID
.Dl and a varchar containing the home directory for the user.
.Cd query_credentials
.Dl This is used to provide a query for looking up credentials. All the question marks are replaced
.Dl with the appropriate data, in this case it would be the left hand side of the SMTP address.
.Dl the query expects that there are two varchars returned one with a 
.Dl user name one with a password in
.Xr encrypt 1
.Dl format.
