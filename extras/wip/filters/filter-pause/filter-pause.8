.Nd smtpd filter to pause on new connections
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl s Ar seconds
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a filter for
.Xr smtpd 8
which can be used to pause on new connections before emitting the standard
initial SMTP greeting.
This is useful to avoid the so called
.Dq slamming
technique used by some senders of spam mails.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width "-s seconds"
.It Fl s Ar seconds
Set the number of
.Ar seconds
to pause before sending the initial greeting.
The accepted values are withing the range of 1s and 300s.
.Pp
The default
.Ar seconds
value is 5s.
.El
.Pp
With
.Nm
enabled, smtpd simply waits the specified amount of
.Ar seconds
on each new connection.
If the remote server starts sending SMTP commands before the greeting, the
connection is rejected.
Otherwise, the connection is accepted and normally processed.
