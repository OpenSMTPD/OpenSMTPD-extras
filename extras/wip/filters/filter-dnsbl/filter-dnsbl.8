.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl Cdv
.Op Fl c Ar path
.Op Fl h Ar host
.Op Fl w Ar host
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a filter for
.Xr smtpd 8
which can be used to check new connections against a
DNS-based Blackhole List (DNSBL) and optional a DNS-based Whitelist (DNSWL).
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width "-c path"
.It Fl C
No
.Xr chroot 2
mode, if this option is specified,
.Nm
will not run in a chroot.
.It Fl c Ar path
Set the chroot
.Ar path .
.Pp
The default
.Ar path
is
.Pa /var/empty
(compile option).
.It Fl d
Debug mode, if this option is specified,
.Nm
will run in the foreground and log to
.Em stderr .
.It Fl h Ar host
Set the DNSBL
.Ar host
to be queried.
.Pp
The default
.Ar host
is dnsbl.sorbs.net.
.It Fl v
Produce more verbose output.
.It Fl w Ar host
Set the DNSWL
.Ar host
to be queried.
.Pp
The default is to not query a DNSWL
.Ar host .
.El
.Pp
.Nm
runs by default in a chroot.
In order to make DNS queries working, a valid
.Pa resolv.conf
is required within the chroot.
.Pp
The debug and verbose options given with the
.Xr smtpd 8
invocation are intially passed to
.Nm .
.Pp
The remote IP address of new connections is used in a DNS query against the
DNSBL and optional DNSWL.
If the remote address is listed in the DNSBL, the connection is rejected,
otherwise accepted.
If the optional DNSWL host is given, it is queried first and if the remote
address is listed the connection is accepted (without checking the DNSBL).
