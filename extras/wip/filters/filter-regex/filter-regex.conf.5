.Sh NAME
.Nm filter-regex.conf
.Nd filter-regex configuration file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is the configuration file for
.Xr filter-regex 8 .
.Pp
The file consists of rules that, when matched, cause
.Xr filter-regex 8
to reject mails.
.Pp
The current line can be extended over multiple lines using a trailing backslash
.Pq Sq \e .
Comments can be put anywhere in the file using a hash mark
.Pq Sq # ,
and extend to the end of the current line.
Emtpy lines and lines starting with
.Sq #
are ignored, as well as leading whitespaces.
.Pp
The syntax of
.Nm
is described below.
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Xo
.Ic connect
.Op Ic \&!
.Pf < Ar hostname Ns >
.Xc
Reject the connection if the connection sender's
.Ar hostname
matches the specified regular expressions.
.It Xo
.Ic helo
.Op Ic \&!
.Pf < Ar name Ns >
.Xc
Reject the connection if the sender supplied HELO
.Ar name
matches the specified regular expression.
.It Xo
.Ic mail
.Op Ic \&!
.Pf < Ar address Ns >
.Xc
Reject the mail if the sender supplied MAIL FROM
.Ar address
matches the specified regular expression.
.It Xo
.Ic rcpt
.Op Ic \&!
.Pf < Ar address Ns >
.Xc
Reject the mail if the sender supplied RCPT TO
.Ar address
matches the specified regular expression.
.It Xo
.Ic dataline
.Op Ic \&!
.Pf < Ar line Ns >
.Xc
Reject the mail if a data (header or body)
.Ar line
matches the specified regular expression.
.El
.Sh REGULAR EXPRESSIONS
The regular expressions used in the configuration rules do not need further
escaping.
.Pp
The optional
.Sq \&!
character in front of the regular expression (separated by a whitespace)
reverses the matching result and causes the rule, when matched, to be accepted.
This is considered a negotiation and break operation, thus allows exceptions to
the actual rejection rules.
.Pp
All subsequent argument characters up to the end of the line are taken
literally as the regular expression.
.Pp
See
.Xr re_format 7
for a detailed description of basic and extended regular expressions.
.Sh EXAMPLES
The default filter-regex.conf file which ships with OpenSMTPD-extras contains
commented examples.
